Hi, I’m @jaoocaminhao, AKA João Pedro, a brazilian student of python :)
I’m interested in coding (lol), pretending to be a kind of full stack developer, though I wouldn't work with both backend and frontend at the same 
time (I'm not that crazy haha). My dream is to study Software Engineering on College and work developing software, in a big and great organization!
I’m currently learning python, which I found sooo cool!! Wanna learn more everyday haha.
To reach me, please DM me on ig (@joaovieiraa_) or just email me (joaopedrocvieiraa@gmail.com). Hope we can chat and help each other!!
